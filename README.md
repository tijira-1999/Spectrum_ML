# Spectrum_ML
Internship project based on data science concepts

Using Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, pandas and statsmodel.api

##  Project Report

This is a project based on the machine learning which consisted of three tasks.

#### Task 1
    Extract relevent data from a dictionary provided(scores) and use it to plot a graph between day and score.
    
#### Task 2
    Given a dataset calculate the final grade from the three grades 
    and plot a scatter plot and a box plot between final_grade & study time.

#### Task 3
    Given a datashet 
        1. Apply encoding(label encoding/One hot encoding) to convert non-numerical values to categorical values to feed our model.
        2. Then by using "sklearn's train_test_split" divide the dataset to 4 categories for training and testing our model.
        3. Plot a scatter plot for the predicted and true value.
        4. Using Backward elimination to remove non-important features to reduce the complexity of the model and also increasing the accuracy.
        5. Finally training the model with the important independent features derived from the above step.
